--------------------------------------------

Thank you for choosing to use the ATbar webpage embedder for web developers.

It is simple to install and will mean your site will benefit from having more accessibility options as well as allowing personal preferences for viewing your pages.


---- How to embed ATbar on your site ----

1. Add the following code to your website header:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="atbar.css">
	
Alter the href according to where you wish to store the CSS file.
Alternatively copy the CSS script and include it in your own CSS file.

2. Add the following code just after the <body> tag on your site.
   It is important that the ATbar image is high up on the tab order list.
   
	<?php include('toolbar-launcher.php'); ?>
